     |  | Feedback |
     | 1 | The physician's handmaiden was/is a nursing stereotype rather than an influence on nursing. |
     | 2 | Although there has been a need for healthcare outside the home throughout history, this has more influence on the development of hospitals than on nursing; this need provided one more setting for nursing work. |
     | 3 | Throughout the centuries, stability of the government has been related to the success of the military to protect or extend its domain. As the survival and well-being of soldiers are both critical, nurses provided healthcare to the sick and injured at the battle site. |
     | 4 | Germ theory and sanitation helped to improve healthcare but did not shape nursing. |

          |  | Feedback |
          | 1 | Illness-prevention activities focus on avoiding a specific disease. A food diary is a health-promotion activity. |
          | 2 | Although cancer is a disease, it is assumed that a person joining a support group would already have the disease; therefore, this is not disease prevention but treatment. |
          | 3 | Administering immunization for HPV is an example of illness prevention. |
          | 4 | Teaching a diabetic patient about diet is a treatment for diabetes; the patient already has diabetes, so it cannot prevent diabetes. |

                    |  | Feedback |
                    | 1 | A substantial portion of the nursing role involves using clinical judgment, critical thinking, and problem solving, which directly affect the care the client will actually receive. |
                    | 2 | Providing hands-on care is important; however, clinical judgment, critical thinking, and problem-solving are essential to do it successfully. |
                    | 3 | Carrying out physician orders is a small part of a nurse’s role; it, too, requires nursing assessment, planning, intervention, and evaluation. |
                    | 4 | Many simple nursing tasks are being delegated to nursing assistive personnel; delegation requires careful analysis of patient status and the appropriateness of support personnel to deliver care. |

                              | 1 | The conflicting images of nursing make it more important to develop a definition; they may also make it more difficult but not to the extent that constant change does. |
                              | 2 | Healthcare is constantly changing and with it come changes in where, how, and what nursing care is delivered. Constant changes make it difficult to develop a definition. |

                              | 4 | The different education pathways affect entry into practice, not the definition of nursing. |

Before the fall, the patient lived at home with her spouse and managed their activities of daily living (ADLs) very well. The hospital is ready to discharge the patient because the recommended length of stay in a hospital has been exceeded. However, she cannot walk or perform ADLs independently. She requires lengthy physical therapy and further monitoring of medications and both physical and mental status. To which type of facility should the patient be transferred?
